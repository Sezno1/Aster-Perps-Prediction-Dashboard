# Critical Gaps in ASTER Scanner

## ‚ùå MISSING: Historical Data Training

### Current Status:
- AI only looks at **current moment** data
- NO historical price patterns
- NO volume analysis (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h trends)
- NO past price movements to learn from

### What's Needed:
1. **Historical Price Database**
   - Store every price point (1-second granularity)
   - Track volume changes over 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 24h
   - Build pattern recognition database

2. **Volume Analysis**
   - Current: Only shows 24h volume as single number
   - Needed: Volume trends (increasing/decreasing)
   - Needed: Volume spikes detection
   - Needed: Compare current 5m volume to average

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Support/resistance levels from history
   - Previous pump/dump patterns
   - Time-of-day volume patterns
   - Successful trade patterns from past

## ‚ùå MISSING: Volume Data in AI

### Current:
- AI prompt does NOT include volume data
- AI doesn't know if volume is increasing/decreasing
- No 5-minute volume comparison

### Fix Needed:
Add to AI prompt:
```
- 24h Volume: $X (trend: increasing/decreasing)
- 5m Volume: X ASTER (vs 1h avg: +50%)
- Volume spike detected: YES/NO
```

## ‚ùå BUG: Volume Showing $0

The volume data exists in backend but returns 0 to frontend.
Likely cause: Race condition or data not being passed through correctly.

## ‚úÖ What's Working:

1. Real-time price updates (1 second)
2. Multi-strategy analysis
3. AI learning from trade outcomes
4. Order flow analysis
5. Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
6. Trade logging with actual profit/loss

## üî• Priority Fixes:

1. **FIX VOLUME BUG** - Make $2.7B volume show on dashboard
2. **ADD HISTORICAL DATABASE** - Store all price/volume data
3. **ENHANCE AI PROMPT** - Include volume trends, patterns
4. **ADD PATTERN DETECTION** - Learn from historical movements
5. **VOLUME TREND ANALYSIS** - Is volume increasing? Spike detection?
