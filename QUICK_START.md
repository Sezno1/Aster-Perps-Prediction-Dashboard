## 🎯 UNDERSTANDING THE STRATEGIES

### **SCALP** (When market is choppy/ranging)
- Leverage: 5-20x
- Hold Time: Minutes
- Target: 0.5-2%
- Best for: Quick in/out trades

### **SWING** (When patterns are clear)
- Leverage: 10-30x
- Hold Time: Hours
- Target: 2-10%
- Best for: Intraday pattern plays

### **POSITION** (When everything aligns)
- Leverage: 25-50x
- Hold Time: Days
- Target: 10-50%+
- Best for: Major cycle-based moves (Your friend's style)

**Right now:** We're in Bull Phase 1, so system favors SWING → POSITION trades.

## 💰 TRADE EXECUTION

When AI signals **BUY**:

1. **Check Master Brain Context:**
   - What phase are we in? (Bull = aggressive, Bear = defensive)
   - What strategy is recommended?
   - Pattern win rate?

2. **Use Recommended Leverage:**
   - System calculates based on confidence + cycle phase
   - Bull Phase 1 = higher leverage OK
   - Bear/Distribution = lower leverage

3. **Set Targets Based on Strategy:**
   - Scalp: Quick 0.5-2% → Exit
   - Swing: Hold for 2-10% → Exit
   - Position: Hold days for 10-50%+ → Exit

4. **Log the Trade:**
   - System automatically tracks outcomes
   - Patterns learn from results
   - Win rates update in real-time

## 📊 PATTERN LIBRARY

### **Current Patterns (Seeded):**

1. **Bullish Flag Breakout** - Strong move → consolidation → breakout
2. **Support Bounce with Volume** - Support + volume spike = bounce
3. **Pullback to 20 EMA** - Buy dips in uptrends
4. **Volume Spike Breakout** - 3x volume = breakout signal
5. **Double Bottom** - Classic reversal at lows
6. **Asia Dump, US Pump** - Time-based pattern

These are **starter patterns**. System will discover YOUR own patterns as you trade.

## 🔍 FINDING YOUR OWN PATTERNS

### **Weekly Pattern Mining:**

```bash
# Mine BTC patterns (general market behavior)
python3 pattern_miner.py

# Mine ETH patterns
# Modify pattern_miner.py to use 'ETH/USDT' instead of 'BTC/USDT'

# TODO: Add ASTER historical data, then mine ASTER-specific patterns
```

When you find a pattern with 70%+ win rate:
1. System adds it to pattern library
2. AI starts watching for it
3. Recommends trades when pattern appears
4. Tracks performance and adjusts

---

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM TRADES

Every trade outcome teaches the system:

**Winning Trade:**
- Pattern win rate increases
- AI gives it more weight in decisions
- Strategy confidence grows

**Losing Trade:**
- Pattern analyzed for what went wrong
- Maybe wrong market regime for that pattern?
- AI adjusts when to use it

**Goal:** Reach 90%+ win rate by discovering what works for ASTER specifically.
